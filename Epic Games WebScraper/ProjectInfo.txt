We will be Creating an Epic Games WebScraper :

-> Project is based on Automation and Webscraping implemented using NodeJS


-> Features of the Project:

• Input : From Command Line

1. Automation Part : 
• Input name of a game in command line and it will redirect to epic games store and search the game and 
  redirect to the page containing all games and filter out all games that matches the input we have given 
  and fetch us the url of the current page.

2. WebScraping : 
• Once we got the url of required page , it fetches the required game 
  data (i.e, game name , game info , System Requirements to check 
  whether he game is compatible on our system or not, etc.) 

• Then we create a folder and inside that we create text file with 
  the respective game name and store all the data of the game in the text file

2. For WebScraping :
